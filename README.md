# Releases

A list of projects and their versions, group by the release they appear in, generated using the [release-downloader script](https://github.com/apple-open-source-mirror/scripts/blob/master/release_downloader.py). Releases are formatted as follows:

```
release:project-version,project-version,...
release:project-version,project-version,...
...
```

Release names usually contain an OS or tool name along with a version number.
